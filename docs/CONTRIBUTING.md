# How to contribute

## High-level steps

Please follow the below steps when contributing to Remill.

1. Create an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/trailofbits/remill/issues/new)
   describing the goals and milestones of your contribution. For example, if
   you want to implement a particular class of instructions, then create a
   checkbox list within your issue for each instruction.

2. Create a branch with a short and descriptive name. If you created Issue N for
   your branch, then a candidate name the branch could be `issue_N_short_description`.
   Prefixing the branch name with `issue_N_` is not required. For example, if
   your issue is "Implement MMX instructions", then two good branch names would
   be `mmx_support`, or `issue_N_mmx_support`.

3. Use the milestone checkboxes and comments section to track the progress of
   your branch and request feedback.

4. Make either incremental, or "complete" [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
   based on your branch. An incremental pull request is appropriate when you've
   reached one or more milestones, your branch is in a mergable state, and all
   tests pass.
